# Privacy Policy for Squeeze Pix

**Last Updated: [Date]**

Thank you for using Squeeze Pix ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application, Squeeze Pix (the "App").

Your privacy is important to us. Our goal is to provide you with a great image compression tool without compromising your personal data.

## 1. Information We Collect

Our App is designed to function with minimal data collection.

### a) Information You Provide

*   **Images:** The core function of Squeeze Pix is to compress images you select from your device's gallery or camera. These images are processed **locally on your device**. We do not upload, store, or have access to your original or compressed images on any server.

### b) Information Collected Automatically Through Third-Party Services

We use third-party services to show advertisements within the App, which helps keep the App free. These services may collect information automatically.

*   **Unity Ads:** Our advertising partner, Unity Ads, may collect and use data to provide personalized advertising. This data may include:
    *   **Device Identifiers:** Such as your device's advertising ID (IDFA for iOS, GAID for Android).
    *   **Device Information:** Device make and model, operating system, and language settings.
    *   **Network Information:** IP address, which may be used to estimate your general location.
    *   **Ad-Related Information:** Data about the ads you have seen, clicked on, or interacted with.

For more detailed information on what data Unity Ads collects and how they use it, please review the [Unity Privacy Policy](https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information collected is used for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the App:** To perform the core functionality of image compression.
*   **To Display Advertisements:** To support the App financially by showing relevant ads through Unity Ads.
*   **To Improve Our Services:** We may analyze aggregated, non-identifiable usage data to understand how our App is used and how we can improve it.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information.

*   **Your Images:** We reiterate that your images are processed locally and are **never** shared with us or any third party by the App. You have full control over sharing your compressed images using your device's native sharing functionality.
*   **Third-Party Advertisers:** Data collected automatically, as described in section 1(b), is shared with our advertising partner (Unity Ads) to facilitate the delivery of ads.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

All image processing and storage of compressed files occur locally on your device. You are responsible for managing these files. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect the information handled by our App, please remember that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices (Opting Out of Personalized Ads)

You can opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting the settings on your mobile device.

*   **On Android:** Navigate to `Settings > Google > Ads` and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization."
*   **On iOS:** Navigate to `Settings > Privacy > Tracking` and disable tracking for the Squeeze Pix app. You can also go to `Settings > Privacy > Apple Advertising` and turn off "Personalized Ads."

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
